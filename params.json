{"name":"NYC Food Inspection Map","tagline":"","body":"# Find local NYC Restaurant Inspection Grades\r\nGoal: In this project I used the Google Maps API to enable me to search restaurants local to NYC and \r\nreturn inspection letter grades from the NYC Open Data API. \r\n\r\nResults are restricted to NY. Results will be returned in right hand panel. You can also further \r\nfilter within results by selecting checkbox and re-entering a search query. If there is no inspection grade,\r\nresults will be returned from Maps API only. \r\n\r\nMore information about NYC inspection letter grading system can be found here:\r\nhttp://www.ehagroup.com/food-safety/new-york-abc-restaurant-grading/\r\n\r\nTechnologies used:\r\n* Google Maps API\r\n* Knockout\r\n* jQuery\r\n* NYC Open Data API\r\n\r\nIn order to use, open index.html. When you enter a query a list of restaurants with their addresses (Only Manhattan/Brooklyn)\r\nwill be returned. When clicking on the name of a restaurant the map will pan to the restaurant location causing an \r\ninfowindow to open with the following information:\r\n\r\nName\r\nLocation\r\nUser Rating\r\nFood Inspection Rating\r\nWebsite \r\n\r\nThe marker will also bounce until either a new restaurant is selected, or the infowindow is closed.
