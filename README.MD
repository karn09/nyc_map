# Find local NYC Restaurant Inspection Grades
Goal: In this project I used the Google Maps API to enable me to search restaurants local to NYC and 
return inspection letter grades from the NYC Open Data API. 

Results are restricted to NY. Results will be returned in right hand panel. You can also further 
filter within results by selecting checkbox and re-entering a search query. If there is no inspection grade,
results will be returned from Maps API only.
